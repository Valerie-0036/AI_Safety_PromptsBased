# Agent Security with Qualifire

This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Qualifire into your AI agent workflows to implement robust guardrails and take preemptive action against common LLM vulnerabilities such as prompt injections, unsafe content, hallucinations, and policy breaches. You will learn how to use both the Gateway and the SDK to protect your agents.
